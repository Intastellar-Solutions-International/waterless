            <h1>Waterless Scandinavia – Leading the Way in Sustainable Restroom Solutions</h1>
            <p>At Waterless Scandinavia, we believe that sustainability starts with smarter choices. Traditional urinals consume vast amounts of clean drinking water daily—an unnecessary waste of one of our planet’s most precious resources. Our waterless urinals eliminate the need for flushing, setting a new standard for environmental responsibility in restroom design.</p>

                <h1>Waterless Scandinavia – Pioneers in Water-Free Innovation</h1>
                <p>We were the first company in Denmark to introduce waterless urinals, and today, we remain one of the global leaders in the field.</p>
                <p>Our journey began back in 1991, with the first trials and pilot installations. Since then, the idea of waterless urinals has proven to be a highly sustainable solution.</p>
                <p>Since 1997, Waterless Scandinavia has been firmly established in the Danish market with our own sales and service team, based in Sønderborg.</p>
                <p>At Waterless Scandinavia, customer satisfaction is everything. That’s why we’re committed to delivering top-quality service that meets the highest professional standards.</p>
